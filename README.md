## Statsig .NET SDK

This is the .NET SDK for both single-user client side and multi-user server side usage. If you need a SDK for another language, check out our [other SDKs](https://docs.statsig.com/#sdks).

Statsig helps you move faster with Feature Gates (Feature Flags) and Dynamic Configs. It also allows you to run A/B tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs. If you're new to Statsig, create an account at [statsig.com](https://www.statsig.com).
